% question 2a

% if an offset is added to the output of the non-linearity, theoretically
% the sound remains the same since the vibrations created would be the same
%, just about a different 'mean'.

% question 2b


[y,fs] = wavread('sineDist00.wav');
title('DC offset = 0 without DC blocker')
[z,fs] = wavread('sineDist10.wav');
title('DC offset = 1 without DC blocker')

subplot(2,1,1), spectrogram(y(:,1),blackman(16384));
subplot(2,1,2), spectrogram(z(:,1),blackman(16384));

% the 2 plots are for DC Offset of 0.5 and 0.9
% DC Offset 0.5 has more energy and is spread out near the fundamental and
% its harmonics. For DC Offset 0.9, the energy gets narrowly concentrated
% near the fundamental and their harmonics. Both of them have even an odd
% harmonics
